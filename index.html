          Always up for a challenge, I have worked for lean start-ups and was a
          member of the first New Zealand start-up to attend Y Combinator, the
          largest start-up accelerator in the world. From there, I worked my way
          up to Art Director and Team Lead at Appster where I oversaw the design
          of 30+ mobile and desktop apps. Currently I am a Senior Product
          Designer at Linktree leading design for the Linktree mobile app
